# BucketList_

##Descripton:
BucketList_ aims to revolutionize the way traveling is conducted in the everyday life of wunderlust individuals. Users enter a bucketlist of places to go, a duration of time to stay in these places, a budget, and timeframe within which they want to complete this list by - they may also include optional events they want to do. 

BucketList_ then aggregates the information and comes up with a list of possible travel times based on a users' Calender. Their availability is used as a refrence to come up with an optimal time to go on a trip. 

With BucketList_ the opportunities are endless. 

##Notes:
In order to get QJSONObject working with C++ we used `brew install qt5` from Homebrew to get the latest version of QT working with our library documents.
